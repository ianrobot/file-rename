# Copy \<50 files to another dir and rename to ([1-4][0-9]|50).\<filetype\>
This is just a small programm that could be easly done using a shellscript, however it should be platform independent.
It's made for a friend who has a loop station that exclusivly accapts an input of \<50 audio files following the above filename pattern.
Files are copied instead of "moved" to not loose the original file on errors while processing.
